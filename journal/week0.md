# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture
**Business Scenario :**

Your company has asked to put together a technical presentation on the proposed architecture that will be implemented so it can be reviewed by the fractional CTO.
Your presentation must include a technical architectural diagram and breakdown of possible services used along with their justification.
The company also wants to generally know what spend we expect to encounter and how we will ensure we keep our spending low.

### Install and verify AWS CLI
These commands allowed me to download and install AWS CLI in the gitpod environment
```
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
```



Update my .gitpod.yml to include the following task
```yml
tasks:
  - name: aws-cli
    env:
      AWS_CLI_AUTO_PROMPT: on-partial 
    init: |
      cd /workspace
      curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
      unzip awscliv2.zip
      sudo ./aws/install
      cd $THEIA_WORKSPACE_ROOT
```

### Set environment variables
The following examples show how you can configure environment variables for the default user.
This is not my security credentials

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-west-2"
```

To save our sercurity credentials in gitpod :

```
gp env AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE"
gp env AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"
gp env AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-west-2"
```
Get-caller-identity command is equivalent to whoami
```

```
