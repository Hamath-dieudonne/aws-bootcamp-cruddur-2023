# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture
**Business Scenario :**

Your company has asked to put together a technical presentation on the proposed architecture that will be implemented so it can be reviewed by the fractional CTO.
Your presentation must include a technical architectural diagram and breakdown of possible services used along with their justification.
The company also wants to generally know what spend we expect to encounter and how we will ensure we keep our spending low.
