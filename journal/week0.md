### Install and verify AWS CLI
These commands allowed me to download and install AWS CLI in the gitpod environment
```
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
```

Update my .gitpod.yml to include the following task
```yml
tasks:
  - name: aws-cli
